Oxcart is a prototype Clojure compiler which seeks to provide
aggressive AOT compilation for performance and memory usage. At present
Oxcart is a holding tank for changes which will likely be split up
between
[tools.emitter.jvm](https://github.com/clojure/tools.emitter.jvm),
[tools.analyzer.jvm](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.jvm)
and some future `tools.optimizer.jvm`.
