> Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up
> on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he
> sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed
> check". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey,
> Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar
> cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it,
> ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount
> Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest
> dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how
> much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with
> that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than
> emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."
>
> Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back
> seat. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los
> Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"
> There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday
> request. "Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and
> forty-two knots, across the ground."
>
> I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so
> accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without
> hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point
> at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends
> for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his
> most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're
> showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."
>
> For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack
> in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A. came back with,
> "Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than
> ours. You boys have a good one."
>
> It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable
> sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal
> airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and
> more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a
> crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that
> frequency all the way to the coast.

Oxcart is a prototype Clojure compiler which seeks to provide
aggressive AOT compilation for performance and memory usage. At present
Oxcart is a holding tank for changes which will likely be split up
between
[tools.emitter.jvm](https://github.com/clojure/tools.emitter.jvm),
[tools.analyzer.jvm](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.jvm)
and some future `tools.optimizer.jvm`.
